SQL (Structured Query Language) is used for music store data analysis because it allows efficient management, querying, and manipulation of large datasets. 

In a music store context, SQL helps analyze sales, track inventory, customer preferences, and trends. 

It can retrieve specific data like the most popular songs, genres, or artists, perform aggregate functions like counting sales, and join multiple tables (e.g., albums, artists, and sales) to derive insights crucial for decision-making and business strategy.
